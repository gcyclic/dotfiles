<h1 align="center">Dotfiles</h1>

This repository contains my personal [dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) for various GNU/Linux programs. It is also mirrored here, on [GitHub](https://github.com/gcyclic/dotfiles). I manage my dotfiles using tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
